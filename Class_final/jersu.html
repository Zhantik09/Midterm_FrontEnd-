        <h2>Jer-Su - “sacred land - water”</h2>
        <p>
            The word Jer-Su had two meanings among the ancient Turks. One as the visible world - the native earth-water, the other as a deity living in the Middle World. The Turkic goddess was represented as a beautiful woman who patronized the homeland of the Turkic people. Therefore, Jer-Su was revered as the highest deity after Tengri and Umai. The Turks were sure that the patronage of this goddess brings happiness: “At the top, the Tengri of the Turks and the Turkic sacred Jer-Su said this: “Let the Turkic people not disappear!” Let there be a people!”
