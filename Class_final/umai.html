        <h2>Umai - the Supreme Goddess of the whole Earth.</h2>
        <p>
        According to legend, a swan goddess lives on White Mountain, beautiful as the rays of the morning sun, as bright as fresh mountain snow. Umai covers the Altai mountains with his snow-white, caring wings. Umai, in the form of a swan, could swim on water, walk on land and rise into the sky. She took part in the creation of the world, when there was nothing but the Great Ocean. On its surface, Umai the Swan proudly contemplated the world. One day, diving deep into the water, she pulled out the earth from the bottom, and from it grew great mountains, wide rivers, and all the plants and animals. However, the God of Darkness kept trying to overtake her in order to capture her in his cold embrace. One day, fleeing from him, Umai turned into the White Mountain, she covered her children with her wings, and they petrified her with its extreme peaks.

        <p>
         Umai‚Äôs soul hovers above her earthly body. At the same time, Umai resides in two worlds. Wise nomads honored the mother of all people - the goddess of the Earth, Tengri's wife, and therefore put women on an equal footing with men.

            The mother of all people and nature, from her comes a pleasant light, like a golden ray - shine, since she is kind and gentle. She stands barefoot on the ground in a thick bowl of the forest, beautiful and pregnant. She is with the sign of Shanyrak drawn on the navel, which means - the beginning of everything.</p>
