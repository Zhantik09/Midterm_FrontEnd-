            Once upon a time there was neither earth nor sky, but only one vast ocean. One day, a White Light appeared inside the ocean - Ak Zharyk, from which a shining golden egg was formed. Inside it slept the god Tengri, the future progenitor of the whole world. He slept for a very long time, millions and millions of years, and then one day he woke up. Tengri broke the egg shell and went outside. From the upper part of the egg Tengri created the Sky, and from the lower part he made the Earth. To prevent the Sky from falling to Earth and chaos reigning again, Tengri placed a staff between them - the Heavenly stake - Temir Kazyk - the Polar Star. Tengri tied the heavenly horses, stars and constellations to the North Star, which walk all around the Sky
