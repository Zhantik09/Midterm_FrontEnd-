The rich man's house was spacious and beautiful. It is full of gold and silver. And the poor man's house was made of wood, and the roof was covered with bushes. He barely earned his bread, let alone gold and silver. He sowed crops, watered them, waited for them, reaped them and saw his day. One warm spring, there will be a disaster, a flood. The rich man climbs the tree with his gold. And if he is poor, he puts a piece of silver bread in his lap and climbs up the tree.</p>

                -Oh, poor man, take this piece of gold and give me a piece of bread, he says.</p>
                <p class="parallax-text fade-in">- No, I can't give you gold, I can't give you bread, - answers the poor man. On the second day, the rich begs the poor again for bread. "I'll give you half of my gold," he says this time.</p>

                The poor man does not give in anyway. The rich man lost his strength, his head spins and he falls into the water. And the next day the water stops and the poor tree falls from the top.</p>
